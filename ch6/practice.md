**6.1 In Section 6.4, we mentioned that disabling interrupts frequently can affect the systemâ€™s clock. Explain why this can occur and how such effects can be minimized.**<br>
- System's clock can be kept by interrupts, as HZ specifies the frequency of timer interrupts. By disabling interrupts the timer may not update. This effect could be minimized by setting higher timer value. <br>

**6.2 What is the meaning of the term busy waiting? What other kinds of waiting are there in an operating system? Can busy waiting be avoided altogether? Explain your answer.**<br>
- Busy waiting: While a process is in its critical section, any other process that tries to enter its critical section must loop continuously in the call to acquire().
- Besides the spinlock, process can also suspend itself. It's another kind of waiting.
- Busy waiting cannot be completely eliminated. It was limited by the wait() and signal(). Anyway, processes need to wait for critical-section to execute their jobs. <br>

**6.3 Explain why spinlocks are not appropriate for single-processor systems yet are often used in multiprocessor systems.**<br>

**6.4 Show that, if the wait() and signal() semaphore operations are not executed atomically, then mutual exclusion may be violated.**<br>

**6.5 Illustrate how a binary semaphore can be used to implement mutual exclusion among n processes.**<br>

**6.6 Race conditions are possible in many computer systems. Consider a banking system that maintains an account balance with two functions: deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount). These two functions are passed the amount that is to be deposited or withdrawn from the bank account balance. Assume that a husband and wife share a bank account. Concurrently, the husband calls the withdraw() function, and the wife calls deposit(). Describe how a race condition is possible and what might be done to prevent the race condition from occurring.**<br>
